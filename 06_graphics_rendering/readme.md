# Graphics Rendering -- Learning Objectives

**What?**

In the upcoming four lectures, we will look into selected topics from computer graphics with the intention to shed light on the general graphics rendering process. In this first lecture, we will look into the following aspects:

- Computer graphics history
- Graphics rendering basics
- Euclidian geometry and vertices
- 3D geometric objects and triangles exercises

**Why?** 

A short overview of the history of computer graphics will serve as a context for the lecture and provide you with - hopefully - interesting insights into the development of computer graphics over the last decades. Graphics rendering basics will briefly introduce the main goals of computer graphics and distinguish it from, i.e., image processing. Finally, an understanding of euclidian geometry is essential when dealing with computer graphics not only for scene and object creation but, as we will see later on, also for scene setup, object manipulation and many other aspects of graphics rendering. We will end this lecture with a couple of exercises on 3d geometric object generation and vertex manipulation.

## Computer Graphics History

### Lecture Video

The following lecture video presents you with selected milestones from computer graphics history. Check out the video presentation at the following address and the accompanying slides in the resources folder:

### Additional Material

Please checkout in particular the video reference added to the "VolLibre" film. It shows you how much geometry and mathematics are interwined with computer graphics and how different subjects and/or research areas can influence each other.
