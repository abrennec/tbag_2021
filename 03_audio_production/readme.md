# Audio Production -- In the Mix and Sound Production 


## Topics

- Digital Audio Workstation
- Tracks, instruments, and FX
- Basics of Mixing 
- Dynamics and panning (sound space basics)
- Audio FX (Reverb, delay, equalizer)
- Applications: Audio Processing and Production


## Learning Objectives

Now that students know about the basics of sound and audio they will learn how to process audio.

- Students will learn about audio signal processing, i.e., theory behind audio signals and signal flow.
- Students will learn about how recorded audio signals will be routed and mixed in a digital audio workstation (DAW).
- Students will learn about how audio tracks can be further processed using audio effects (FX).
- Students will learn how to create an audio mix and how to position their sound sources in a stereo mix.


# Digital Audio Signals

Signal represents a quantity that varies over time
Audio signal is a representation of sound 
audio signals can be represented electronically in analog & digital formats as continuous and discrete signals
digital processors operate mathematically on the binary representations of the signal
digital audio expresses the pressure waveform as a binary number

Signal - A formal description of a phenomenon evolving over time and space (1D - Sound, 2D - Image, 3D -Movie)
Signal processing - An operation that modifies, analyzes, changes the information contained in a signal
Operates on an abstract representation of a physical quantity not on the quantity itself
Digital - Everything can be represented as a finite integer number
