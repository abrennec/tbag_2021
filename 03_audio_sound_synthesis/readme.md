# Sound Synthesis -- Digital Sound Generation and Analysis


## Topics

1. Sound generation and snythesizers
2. Waveforms and their mathematical description
3. Additive and subtractive synthesis
4. Audio analysis with FFT
5. Project work


## Learning Objectives

Students know about the basics of sound and digital audio and are capable of processing different audio tracks in a DAW. 

- Students will learn about sound synthesis and computer generated sounds.
- Students will learn about waveforms, oscillators and different types of sound synthesis.
- Students will get an overview of different audio programming languages and get an introduction to SuperCollider.
- Students will create their own sounds using both a synthesizer and an audio programming language.

# Assignments


- Check out the [spectogram app](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram/). 
  - What do you understand from the information provided by the spectogram? 
  - What is a spectogram?


- Check out [Teropa's harmonic explorer](https://teropa.info/harmonics-explorer/) and play with the frequency and amplitude parameters. Also, add more and more simple sound waves (in this case, sine waves) together. 
  - What do you notice? 
  - How do the sounds sound like?
