# Sound Synthesis -- Digital Sound Generation and Analysis


## Topics

1. Sound generation and snythesizers
2. Waveforms and their mathematical description
3. Additive and subtractive synthesis
4. Audio analysis with FFT
5. Project work


## Learning Objectives

Students know about the basics of sound and digital audio and are capable of processing different audio tracks in a DAW. 

- Students will learn about sound synthesis and computer generated sounds.
- Students will learn about waveforms, oscillators and different types of sound synthesis.
- Students will get an overview of different audio programming languages and get an introduction to SuperCollider.
- Students will create their own sounds using both a synthesizer and an audio programming language.
