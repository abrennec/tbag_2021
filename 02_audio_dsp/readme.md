# Audio Processing -- Properties of Sound and Digital Audio Fundamentals


## Topics

- Digital audio signals and signal flow 
- Mixing audio and audio production
- Audio FX
- Applications: Audio Processing and Production


## Learning Objectives

Now that students know about the basics of sound and audio they will learn how to process audio.

- Students will learn about audio signal processing, i.e., theory behind audio signals and signal flow.
- Students will learn about how recorded audio signals will be routed and mixed in a digital audio workstation (DAW).
- Students will learn about how audio tracks can be further processed using audio effects (FX).
- Students will learn how to create an audio mix and how to position their sound sources in a stereo mix.
