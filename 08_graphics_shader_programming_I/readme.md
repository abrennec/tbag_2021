# Graphics -- Transformations


## Topics


1. The programmable rendering pipeline
2. Vertex shaders, geometry shaders, tesselation shaders, fragment shaders
3. OpenGL Shader Language
4. My first shader program
5. Project work


## Learning Objectives

- Students will learn 


## Objects

Geometric objects are almost always defined by two groups of properties:

- **Geometric parameters** to define the object's shape 
  and to position the object in the scene.
- **Materials** to define the object's shape and looks with the help of textures or visuals (color information) or specific material properties like reflectivity, mass, elasticity, for instance.

We will focus on geometric parameters here.
