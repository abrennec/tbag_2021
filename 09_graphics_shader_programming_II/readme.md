# Learning Objectives -- Shader Programming II

## What?

In this session, we will work practically and explore several shader example programs that illustrate the possibilities of the vertex and the fragment shader.

## Why?

Because it is fun and you will only learn to use shaders by programming them.

## Further Material

Certainly, the possibilites that come with shader programming are enormous. In particular, when it comes to light effects, different texture processing methods, and more. If you want to dive deeper into shader programming, you need to get an understanding of the different illumination models and a deeper understanding of the rendering pipeline steps. Here is a list of further materials that can help you with this as well as a list of very comprehensible shader tutorials:
