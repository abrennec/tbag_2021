# Audio Rendering Basics

Audio rendering is a term commonly used in the context of digital sound reproduction with a special focus on the rendering process itself. In general, audio rendering targets the processing and mixing together of one ore more **sound sources** (for example, musical instruments, vocals, guitars, drums, etc.) such that an **audio image** or **soundscape** is created ready to be played back on a (specific) set of loudspeakers or headphones, the **output devices**.

# Properties of Sound

## Physical and Psychophysical Aspects

```
“If a tree falls in the forest and no one is near, does it make any sound?“ 
```

Sound is a complex physical (acoustic) and psychophysical (cognitive) phenomenon that involves an understanding of physics and of the human perception. 
Sound as a physical event is defined by how sound is generated and propagated and refers to the **physical aspects** of sound. Sound as a cognitive auditory event is defined by how sound is perceived and processed by the human brain and hearing organs and refers to the **psychophysical aspects** of sound. It is the interaction of these three aspects, **generation**, **propagation**, and **perception**, which enables us to finally hear sound. Put differently, in order to hear a sound, three aspects are needed: 

- a **sound source** that generates sound
- a **medium** through which sound can propagate
- a **listener** who perceives and hears the sound

![sound_overview](imgs/sound_overview.png)


## Sound Generation & Propagation

In order to generate sound, a vibrating object (e.g. a tuning fork) is required which causes a mechanical disturbance in a medium (e.g. air), as depicted in the following illustration: 

![tuning fork](imgs/pressure_wave.gif)
*Image source: https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/sound/tfl.gif*

The vibration of the tuning fork causes the air molecules in its closest proximity to vibrate as well. Their vibration is then transmitted to the next set of molecules in their closest proximity and so on. Hence, the inital disturbance caused by the mechanical movement of the tuning fork causes a chain reaction of smaller or larger disturbances that propagate through the medium. 

It is important to note that the molecules and vibrating objects do not start traveling. It is the energy that is generated by the initial mechanical disturbance that is propagated through the medium. 
The specific form of how this energy travels through the medium is called a **wave**. 

### Longitudinal Wave

When the direction of the vibration that creates the wave is equal to the direction of the wave propagation, i.e., in the same direction, we are talking about a **longitudinal wave**. This happens, for instance, when sound travels through air or gas: 

![longitudinal wave](imgs/longitudinal.gif)
*Image source: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Podelna_vlna.gif*

### Transversal Wave

In contrast, when the direction of vibration that creates the wave is perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation, we are talking about a **transversal wave**. This happes, for instance, when a stone falls into the water or a rope or string vibrate:

![traversal wave](imgs/transversal.gif)
*Image source: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Pricna_vlna.gif*

**Additional Material**

- Check out this interactive [sound wave app](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Sound-Waves/) by Google experiments which depicts a waveform.
- Checkout [this website](http://digitalsoundandmusic.com/2-1-3-longitudinal-and-transverse-waves/) by digitalsoundandmusic.com on more details about longitudinal and transversal waves.


### Sound Pressure Waves

In our context, we will focus on longitudinal waves that exist in a gas like medium like air. 
In a physical sense, these waves are called **pressure waves** because the vibration of air molecules is actually a change of air pressure caused by an alternating sequence of compression and rarefaction, as depicted in the following image:

![sound wave representation](imgs/pressure_wave.png)

As you can see in the illustration, the air molecules depicted at the top of the image are either close to each other or farther away. This depends on the wave propagation and on the current level of compression or rarefaction. In general, the wave propagation and the corresponding pressure change can be described as a function of compression and rarefaction against position or over time. Sine and cosine waves serve well to represent waves mathematically. 

The image also introduces the notion of a **cycle**. A cycle represents one execution of wave propagation from equilibrium (or rest position) to maximum compression, to maximum rarefaction and back to equilibrium. The notion of a cycle is important in the context of frequency.

<!-- The image also introduces the **wavelength** which describes the distance from two conecutive wave crests or troughs. In the context of sound and audio rendering, the wavelength is an important property when it comes to room acoustics.  -->

<!-- The pressure wave is the result of a **mechanical disturbance** in the medium. Hence, to generate sound, a disturbance or **vibration** is required. This vibration might be caused by any kind of **vibrating object** like, for instance, a vibrating speaker membrane, a tuning fork, a drum beat, a slammed door, a guitar strings, or simply an oscillating air particle, to name a few.  -->

For our further considerations, however, two other properties of waves are decisive: **frequency** and **amplitude**:

![amplitude_frequency](imgs/amplitude_frequency.png)


### Amplitude

The amplitude A of a sound wave describes the maximum magnitude/distance of displacement of air molecules from equilibrium (rest position, no movement) either to maximum compression or to maximum rarefaction. Amplitude is always relative to equilibrium where the molecules are in rest position and do not move. This is illustrated in the next Figure:

![amplitude](imgs/amplitude.png)

In a psychophysical sense, amplitude is preceived as **loudness**. The larger the distance from rest position to compression or rarefaction, the louder the sound. 

**Measuring Amplitude**

In this regard, the amplitude of a sound wave is a parameter that expresses the strengths of the changes in (air) **pressure**. It can also serve as a parameter that expresses the amount of **energy** that is transmitted by the sound wave. In the former case, amplitude would usually be measured as **sound pressure level** (SPL) in Pascal (Pa). This quantifies as force per unit area or as Newton per square meter (1 Pa = 1 N/m^2). In the latter case, amplitude would be measured in the form of **sound intensity** (I) which represents the energy (or power in Watts) per unit time and unit area and is measured in Watts/m^2.

The force acting on a surface (left) or the energy passing through a specific area in time (right) is illustrated in the following two illustrations:

![amplitude](imgs/pressure_force.png)



### Frequency

Frequency describes the rate at which the air pressure changes from compression to rarefaction per second. It is measured as **number of cycles per second** in  where **one cycle** is one sequence of an oscillation from equilibrium to pressure compression to rarefaction and back to equilibrium, as depicted in the next Figure:

![frequency](imgs/frequency.png)

In a psychophysical sense, Frequency is perceived as **pitch**. A higher frequency, i.e., a high number of cycles per second is perceived as a higher tone whereas a low frequency, i.e., a small number of cycles per second is perceived as a lower tone.

**Measuring Frequency**

Frequency is measured as **number of cycles per second in Hertz**. In the previous illustration, the left diagram depicts a frequency rate at 2 Hz, i.e., two cycles per second whereas the right diagram depicts a frequency at a rate of 4 Hz, i.e., four cycles per second.

To get an understanding of how Amplitude and Frequency are related, checkout this [interactive applet](http://musicandcomputersbook.com/applets/1_3_hear_freq.php) that allows you to change the two parameters.


### Complex Sounds and Timbre

In the real world sounds are rarely stripped down to one frequency only or purely periodic as in the examples above. Instead, sounds are complex combinations of several different frequencies. Check out the example depicted in the following image from the [musicandcomutersbook.com](http://musicandcomputersbook.com/chapter1/01_01.php):


![complex_sounds](imgs/complex_sounds.png)
*Image source: http://musicandcomputersbook.com/chapter1/01_01.php)*

In this context, the **timbre** of a sound is a recurring term which can be described as the color of a specific tone or even instrument. As we will see, there are different approaches to specify, analyze and to design a sound's timbre, but the complexity of sound generation, propagation and perception makes it difficult to re-create natural timbre. To find out more about the timbre, please see the section on timbre in the [musicandcomputersbook.com](http://musicandcomputersbook.com/chapter1/01_04.php).

## Sound Perception

Anything that we perceive about the physical world is referred to as psychophysical because it is related to the human organs of sensation (for exmaple eyes for seeing and ears for hearing) as well as the interpretation and processing of these sensations by the human brain. In the context of sound, a pressure wave that reaches the human ear is translated into electrochemical impulses and sent to the brain for further processing. This is illustrated in a simplified version below:

![sound perception](imgs/sound_perception.png)

### Hearing

The human auditory system is responsible for the human hearing capabilities and can be broken down into three parts:

- the outer ear,
- the middle ear, 
- the inner ear,

as depicted in the following image:

![ear anatomy](imgs/ear_anatomy.jpg)
*Image source: http://pikeslaneprimary.weebly.com/class-4aj/how-do-we-hear-sounds*


The **outer ear** is comprised of the pinna and the ear canal which form an acoustic system. The individual anatomic characteristics of the pinna help humans localize sound sources and alter the incoming sound waves slightly before they enter the ear canal. When the sound wave reaches the outer part of the eardrum, it sets the eardrum into vibration.

The **middle ear** is comprised of the inner part of the eardrum and the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), small bones that transmit the pressure coming from the eardrum to the inner ear in an optimal way. Imagine the middle ear as a processing unit that translates external vibration into internal vibration.

The **inner ear** is finally responsible of transforming the mechanical energy of the pressure wave into electrochemical impulses which are sent to the human brain. This is mainly carried out by the cochlea, a snail-like organ in the inner ear. The cochlea is filled with cochlear duct, a fluid which is set into motion once a sound wave reaches the inner ear. This fluid's motion interacts with the tiny little hair cells of the basilar membrane which send nerve impulses to the brain. Interestingly, the hair cells of the basilar membrane react to different frequencies depending on their position. to high frequencies the hair cells at the beginning of the membrane react, to low frequencies the hair cells at the end of the basilar membrane react, see also the following illustration:

![ear anatomy](imgs/basilar_membrane.png)


### Human Hearing Range

As we have seen in the previous section, loudness is a psychophysical property related to the amplitude of sound pressure waves. It describes the human perception of the power or intensity of a sound wave's change in pressure. Pitch, on the other hand, is a psychophysical property related to the frequency of a sound wave. It describes how high or low humans perceive a specific sound. 

Note that not all pressure waves can be processed by the human brain as audible. Only those waves that are
within the **human hearing range** will be referred
to as audible and as such are referred to as **sound waves**. 

### Amplitude and Loudness

The **threshold of hearing** refers to the minimum audible pressure amplitude. It is measured in Pascal Pa and
ranges about 10^-5 Pa. In terms of intensity, this corresponds to a minimum intensity of about 10-12 watt per square metre. In terms of Decibel, the threshold of hearing is at 0 dB.

The **threshold of pain** refers to the maximum audible pressure amplitude. The threshold of pain is associated with pressure fluctuation shortly before damage to the hearing organs. It is over 10 Pa. This is one million times the pressure or one trillion times the intensity of the threshold of hearing. In terms of Decibel, the threshold of pain starts at ~90 dB.

- **Threshold of hearing** (silence): ~0,00001 Pa <=> 0 dB
- **Threshold of pain** (hearing damage): ~10 Pa <=>  140 dB, however hearing damage can begin at 90 dB already

These quantifications are difficult to work with in order to describe changes in loudness. Therefore, the decibel has been introduced which is a logarithmic measure to better quantify and relate air pressure changes with the human hearing range, see also the following illustration:

![pressure loudness](imgs/pressure_loudness.png)

<!-- In both cases, the enormous dynamic range of the ear dictates that its response to changes in frequency and intensity must be nonlinear. -->

### Frequency and Pitch

Human hearing capabilities that respond to frequency range from approximately 20 Hz to 20.000 Hz (20 kHz). The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch and vice versa.

- **Lowest frequencies audible by humans** ~20 Hz
- **Highest frequencies audible by humans** ~ 20 kHz

As with the preception of loudness due to changes in air pressure, the enormous dynamic range of the ear in perceiving frequencies is non-linear, too. The following illustration relates the changes in frequency with the changes in pitch: 

![frequency_pitch](imgs/freq_pitch.png)

As you can see, the relation is in logarithmic form. This means, a linear change in pitch, i.e., from note A to the next and next next octaves of A does not correspond to a linear shift in frequencies. Rather, while pitch increases linearly, frequencies double. 

It is interesting to note that perceived loudness varies with intensity and frequency; perceived pitch varies with frequency only though. The human hearing range deacreases with increasing age.

### Exercise - Sound Perception

- **Linear vs logarithmic**: Checkout this [website and sound examples](https://www.audiocheck.net/soundtests_nonlinear.php) to actually *hear* what is meant by linear and logarithmic scales.
- **Hearing range**: Checkout the following two websites that provide sound examples to test the hearing range. Please beware that the final result must not be realistic due to the general surrounding noise and your technical setup which might not playback the sampled frequencies correctly:
  - [High Frequency Range Test (8-22 kHz)](https://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_frequencycheckhigh.php)
  - [Low Frequency Range Test (10-200 Hz)](https://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_frequencychecklow.php)
