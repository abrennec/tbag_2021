# Theoretical Backgrounds of Audio and Graphics Applications

This course provides you with an introduction to the theoretical backgrounds of digital audio and graphics software applications. It is split into one part that focuses on different topics in the field of audio rendering such as digital production, audio processing, synthesis and music computing. The second part focuses on 3D computer graphics and focuses on 3D model generation, transformation, and rendering including an introduction to shader programming.


 ## Topics

1) Audio Rendering 
   1) Digital Audio and Rendering Basics
      1) Properties of sound
      2) Hearing and fundamental acoustics 
      3) Digital representation of sound
      4) Signal flow and digital audio processing
      5) Audio rendering process (interface, driver, playback) and audio buffers
      6) Audio editing software
   2) Audio Production
      1) Digital audio workstation basics
      2) Generating space 
      3) Adding dynamics
      4) 
   3) Musical Sounds and Synthesis
      1) 
   4) Music Computing
      1) 
2) Graphics Rendering 
   1) Graphics Pipeline
      1) Overview of the graphics rendering process
      2) Introduction to the rendering pipeline
      3) Fixed vs programmable pipeline
      4) The role of OpenGL
      5) 3D models 
      6) Vectors and vector meshes
   2) Models and Views (local vs world)
      1) Positioning models in 3D space
      2) Local vs global space
      3) Mathematical description through matrices
      4) 3D space vs 2D screen
      5) Change of dimension
   3) Transformations
      1) Affine transformations
      2) Translation
      3) Rotation
      4) Scaling
      5) Matrix multiplication
   4) Shader programming
      1) Reviewing the rendering pipeline
      2) Understanding what the GPU is good at and what the CPU is good
      3) Basics of a shader program and different shader types
      4) Shader attributes and uniforms
      5) Reviewing and altering vertex meshes with shaders
      6) Handing over variables from vertex to fragment shaders
3) Practical Exercises
   1) Audio - Design and produce a (musical) sound space based on a specific topic (i.e., star wars, spacecraft, city slickers, nature, climate change, ... )
   2) Graphics - Create and implement an interactive or animated graphical counterpart of the sound space with 3d computer graphics, images/textures, and shaders
   3) Final Exercise - Combine the results of the audio and graphics exercises into an interactive or animated audio-visual scene
