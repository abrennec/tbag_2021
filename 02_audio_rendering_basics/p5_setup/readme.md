* If you need to install p5 addons, you can easily install them by pressing `ctrl` / `cmd` + `shift` + `p`, typing `p5` and selecting `Install p5.js Contributor Library`. Id an addon is not available, you have to install it manually. To do that, have a look at <https://p5js.org/libraries/>.
* Every time you don't have access to your setup, but want to do some prototyping, you can use the p5 online editor: <https://editor.p5js.org/>
