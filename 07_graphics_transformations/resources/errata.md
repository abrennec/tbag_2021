## Errata

1) In the original slides "01_tbag_matrices_notes.pdf" and the corresponding video presentation, an error has been made during the matrix multiplication on page 9. This error has been corrected in the current set of slides "01_tbag_matrices_notes_v1.pdf" but the video presentation still contains the error.
