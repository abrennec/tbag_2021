# Theoretical Backgrounds of Audio & Graphics

Repository for the code, slides and resources for the TBAG class at Film University Babelsberg 20/21.

## Purpose of the Course

This course provides you with an introduction to the theoretical backgrounds of digital audio and graphics software applications. In this context, you will learn about the audio and graphics rendering pipelines. 


 ## Topics

         1) Sound waves
         2) Hearing
         3) Stereo, spatial audio
      2) Digital representation of sound 
         1) frequency,
         2) amplitude
      3) Audio Interface, Audio Driver, Digital Audio Workstation, Speakers
         1) Audio buffer 
         2) latency
         3) sampling rate

      7) Exercise
         1) Create field recordings
         2) Edit the samples
         3) Play them back with Sonic pi as a musical piece
         4) Create a sound scape
   4) Audio Analysis / Fourier
      1) Theory, what is Fourier analysis and where is it used?
      2) Audio production workflow with a 
      3) Image-based Fourier as a Counterpart
