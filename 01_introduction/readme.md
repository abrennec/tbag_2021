# Overview of the Course

## Organization 

- Mondays 10:00 h - 13:30 h
- Module 5 | 3 SWS | 4 ECTS
- 10 sessions in total, session 1 & 10 only half of time.
- Participation in the lectures is **not compulsory**. **However**, in order to pass the course and receive a grade, you need to submit homework and take a final practical exercise.

```diff
- The course will be held online until further notice. 
- During the time of online lectures, we will use the lecture hours for updates, discussions and consultation times.
```

## Course Description 

This course provides you with an introduction to the theoretical backgrounds of digital audio and graphics software applications. In this context, you will learn about the audio and graphics rendering pipelines. 

## Method of Instruction

This course will start as an online course which requires an increased amount of personal work and participation in the development of problem solutions. There will be slots for discussions every week. 

Make use of the **Github team** when you are stuck and post your questions there. If you cannot find a solution, get in touch with your tutors.

Each **Monday**, new learning materials and assignments will be published. The time from 10 to 13:30 will be used to work through the materials in the group, in smaller teams and on an individual basis.

### Exercises
- Practical exercises will be part of the lecture sessions to put theory to practice right away.
- Homework assignments will have to be taken to pass the course and collect points for the final grade.
- A final exercise will be assigned at the end of the course and will target an audio-visual piece of application.
- Group work is welcome.

## Syllabus

```diff 
- The syllabus might be subject to change depending on how the general progress and on how the online session format works.
```

1. Introduction to the course (2 hrs)
2. Audio Rendering Basics (4 hrs)
3. Audio Production (4 hrs)
4. Sound Synthesis (4 hrs)
5. Music Computing (4 hrs)
6. Graphics Pipeline (4 hrs)
7. Models and Views (local vs world) (4 hrs)
8. Transformations (4 hrs)
9. Shader programming (4 hrs)
10. Final Exercise + Wrap-up (2 hrs)


## Learning Objectives

Main objective of this course is to get an understanding of digital audio processing as well as 3d computer graphics. The course is split into two parts, audio rendering and graphics rendering. You will learn about mathematical concepts and how they are applied to digital audio and graphics.

The first part, audio rendering, introduces you to the fundamentals of sound and hearing perception, digital audio processing and production as well as sound synthesis and music computing. The theoretical parts will be accompanied with practical exercises so that you can apply the concepts and ideas directly. The notion of sounds in space will be an overarching theme to make you familiar with spatial hearing and sound production. 

In the second part, graphics rendering will be in the foreground of the lecture. Here you will be introduced to the basic concepts of 3D computer graphics and the graphics pipeline. In particular, you will learn about the mathematical concepts behind 3D models, model transformations, viewing and texture, as well as vertex shader programming. Objects in space will also be an overarching theme and the theoretical concepts will be accompanied with practical exercises as well.

At the end of the lecture, a final exercise will allow you to combine both fields in an application and to explore the sounds and objects in space (hopefully!).


## Evaluation and Grading 

In order to **pass the course**, you need to collect 60/100 assignment points. All solutions have to be submitted to GitHub to be considered for an evaluation.

For CTech students there will be a **grade**. The grade will be based on the points collected for the homework assignments and the final exercise. 

### Grading Breakdown <!-- omit in toc -->

The grade is derived from the collected points: you can get 70 points for the homework and 30 points for the final exercise. Bonus points can be awarded for excellent work or additional tasks.

* 70 pts - Homework assignments (due every 2nd week)
* 30 pts - Final exercise (due end of winter term)

### Grading criteria <!-- omit in toc -->

* Correctness of the task
* Overall quality and accuracy (i.e., consistent naming conventions, correct spelling, clean folders (no log files), etc.)
* On time submission

## Communication & Materials


```diff
- To be updated
```
### Platforms

As a communication platform, we will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to share code, lecture materials, comments, and submit homework and project assignments.

- [GitHub repository (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/)
- [GitHub Wiki (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/)
- [GitHub team (public)](https://github.com/orgs/ctechfilmuniversity/)

The repository will be used to share scripts (usually as readme.md) and slides, coding examples, homework and project materials. The Wiki will be maintained by the students to share information that might be useful for everyone, for example, dos and don'ts, useful links, and so on. The team will be used for discussion, comments, notes and any important announcements.

To stay tuned with the materials, clone the main repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/

```

<!-- We will also use a Miro board for group work and collecting, categorizing and storing central topics.

- Miro board (TBD) -->


### Assignments

In many cases, you will be asked to submit your solutions to Github. If so, please submit them to the assignments folder of the corresponding session, i.e., "01_introduction". To do so, go to the assignments folder and create a folder. Name it **<my_last_name>** and put your results into that folder, for example, like so:

```
For any written assignments:
01_intro/assignments/Brennecke/solution.md
```

# Historical Overview of Computer Music

To give you a gentle introduction into the sound and audio topics that we will cover, please checkout the video presentation on central milestones in the history of computer music:

You can find the accompanying slides in the **resources** folder. 

## Musique Concrète

In the video, you learned about **Musique Concrète**. Music Concrète was an essential and critical milestone from a technological as well as from an artistic point of view. It introduced a completely new approach to the process of music making by re-using, altering and adapting pre-recorded sounds. To get an even better understanding of this technique and art form, please also check out the following two articles:

- [All you need to know about Musique Concrète](https://www.musicradar.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-musique-concrete)
- [Pierre Schaeffer und die Musique Concrète](https://museum.rechtaufremix.org/exponate/pierre-schaeffer-und-die-musique-concrete/)


Music concrète will serve as the basis for our first practical exercise in the next session. To prepare that session, please wrap your head around the following questions and use the **Github Wiki** to add additional material, examples, questions and thoughts that we can use as a basis for a discussion next week: 

- What is musique concrète?
- What was so revolutionary about musique concrète?
- Find more audio material online and pick one or two examples that you find interesting. 
- What do you find interesting? How could you imagine using this in an art piece?
- What is interesting from a technological point of view, what from an artistic point of view?
- What would you like to do with it?
